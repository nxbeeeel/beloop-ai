# 📱 Mobile Access Guide

## 🌐 Access Your App from Phone

Your app can be accessed from any device on the same WiFi network using your local IP address.

### 📍 Your Network Details
- **Local IP Address**: `192.168.1.218`
- **Port**: `3000`
- **Access URL**: `http://192.168.1.218:3000`

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Start the Mobile Server
```bash
npm run dev:mobile
```

### 2. Test Server Accessibility
```bash
node test-mobile-access.js
```

### 3. Access from Your Phone
1. Make sure your phone is connected to the same WiFi network
2. Open your phone's browser (Chrome, Safari, etc.)
3. Go to: `http://192.168.1.218:3000`
4. Test all features!

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### ❌ Can't Access from Phone?

#### Check Windows Firewall
1. Open Windows Defender Firewall
2. Click "Allow an app or feature through Windows Defender Firewall"
3. Find "Node.js" in the list
4. Make sure it's checked for both Private and Public networks
5. If not found, click "Allow another app" and add Node.js

#### Alternative: Allow Port 3000
1. Open Windows Defender Firewall
2. Click "Advanced settings"
3. Click "Inbound Rules" → "New Rule"
4. Select "Port" → "TCP" → "Specific local ports: 3000"
5. Allow the connection for all profiles
6. Name it "Next.js Development Server"

#### Check Network Connection
```bash
# Test if your IP is reachable
ping 192.168.1.218

# Check if port 3000 is open
netstat -an | findstr :3000
```

### 🔄 If IP Address Changes
If your IP address changes, run this to find your new IP:
```bash
ipconfig | findstr "IPv4"
```

Then update the access URL accordingly.
